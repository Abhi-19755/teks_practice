    <h1>Subhas Chandra Bose</h1>
    <p>
      Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a great freedom
      fighter and nationalist leader. He was born on January 23, 1897, in
      Cuttack, Odisha. Netaji was known for his fierce patriotism and strong
      leadership skills. He resigned from the Indian Civil Services to join the
      struggle for independence. Bose believed that Indiaâ€™s freedom must be
      achieved through armed revolution. He formed the Indian National Army
      (INA) to fight against British rule. His famous slogan "Give me blood, and
      I will give you freedom" inspired thousands. During World War II, he
      sought support from Germany and Japan for India's liberation. Although his
      death in 1945 remains a mystery, his legacy lives on. Netaji remains one
      of the most respected and bold leaders in Indian history.
